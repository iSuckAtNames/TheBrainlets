# The Brainlets

The Brainlets are a collective representation of Carbon the Wanderer, TheRealEvab, and me, and thus
their abilities are based on the mechanics in other mods that we like-or dislike-the most.

Contains a full set of 75 cards, and the relics and potions will be added later.

Keywords:

Stasis, Accelerate, Tick-See The Guardian

Decelerate-Increase the turn counter of the right-most card in Stasis by 1.

Dead On-See The Hermit (note that this is the mechanic used in the most different way)

Soulburn-See the Hexaghost

Infection-See the Bug Knight
